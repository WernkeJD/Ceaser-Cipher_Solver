# Ceaser-Cipher_Solver
This repository contains both the ceasar cipher solver code and a file encrypted_cipher.txt which contains a fun small paragraph of encrypted text you can try to solve using the code. 
The solver file when run will provide you with each letter in the encrypted text along with the percent frequency with which they appear.
based on this info you can answer the prompts that pop up until you have the text solved.

This is simply version 1 of the code so improvements will come down the road and if you find any bugs please reach out!
