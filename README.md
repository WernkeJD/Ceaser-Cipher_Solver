# Ceaser-Cipher_Solver
This project was a follow-up to a lab I worked on in class which encrypted text using a Ceasar Cipher. I wanted to get more familiar with C++ so I decided to follow up and build the decoder.
This is by no means the most robust encryption method but it was fun and quick to build!

This repository contains both the ceasar cipher solver code and a file encrypted_cipher.txt which contains a fun small paragraph of encrypted text you can try to solve using the code. 
The solver file when run will provide you with each letter in the encrypted text along with the percent frequency with which they appear.
based on this info you can answer the prompts that pop up until you have the text solved.

This is simply version 1 of the code so improvements will come down the road and if you find any bugs please reach out!
